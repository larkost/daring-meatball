The Ten Commandments
===================

With the recent legal wrangling over a law in Louisiana mandating the Ten Commandments be posted in all classrooms in the state, I have seen people defending this by saying that the Ten Commandments is somehow the foundation of either our court or law systems. In the signing ceremony, Louisiana’s Governor, Jeff Landry, said, "If you want to respect the rule of law, you’ve got to start from the original law-giver, which was Moses”. I think that that argument is simply bunk.

I am going to argue this from three angles:
  1. Moses was not the original law giver
  2. Our laws do not resemble the Ten Commandments
  3. Our legal systems stem from pre-Christian Rome


Moses was not the original law giver
------------------------------------

As most know, the Bible says that Moses was (twice) entrusted tablets inscribed with the Ten Commandments. And some would have you believe that these were the first laws. But five of those laws were already given by Noah as part of the Seven Laws of Noah in the book of Genesis, and according to the Talmud, most of those may have been given to Adam as well. And Moses was an Egyptian Prince, and so would have been raised learning the 42 Principles of Maat, as well as the rest of Egyptian law.

And we know other written legal frameworks that predate Moses in that area. Specifically, the Code of Hammurabi is well known and about 300 years earlier (from about 1750 BC). The Code of Ur-Nammu is also from the area and predates that by a few hundred years. Other parts of the world have written legal traditions even older, and those clearly do not have any association with Moses.

So the generic idea of law or even written law starting with Moses and the Ten Commandments does not hold any water, even only using the Bible as a source. He was not even the first to be entrusted with half of the Ten Commandments.


Our laws do not resemble the Ten Commandments
---------------------------------------------

If you look at the Commandments in the Bible, few of them are actual laws in our society. While there are multiple versions and tranlations from different Abrahamic religions, I am going to arbitrarily choose the version specified in Louisiana’s law (itself based on a version of the Protestant King James Bible): 

  1. Thou shalt have no other gods before me.
  2. Thou shalt not make unto thyself any graven images.
  3. Thou shalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain.
  4. Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.
  5. Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.
  6. Thou shalt not kill.
  7. Thou shalt not commit adultery.
  8. Thou shalt not steal.
  9. Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor.
 10. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's house.

Of the Ten Commandments, only three map directly to actual laws in our system: murder, theft, and adultery. It is hard to imagine any functioning society existing without laws on murder or theft (possibly given some judicious definitions of those), and even the Bible is clear that there were other societies than the Israelites. One need look no further than the Egypt that Moses and his followers grew up in as an example.

Adultery is technically a crime in 17 states (a felonly only in 3). But as best I can tell, there is little to no enforcement of those statutes. In 2003 the U.S. Supreme Court decided that restrictions on (non-prostitution) sex between consenting adults, including between married adults, is a Constitutionally protected matter (Lawrence v. Texas). So the third would only count on a historic technicality.

Echoes of the Fourth Commandment (enforcing the Sabbath) can be found in the so-called “Blue Laws”, a few of which are still found in the restrictions on work or alcohol sales on Sunday (the former having been whittled down to time-and-a-half pay). The courts have danced around whether those are religious in nature by citing secular benefits, but again that one is at best marginal.

None of the other six Commandments are laws. Many are usually good things to live by (my kids should pay particular attention to the Fifth Commandment), but they are not offenses you can be put in jail for. Even more, for the first three, it is impossible to square them with the First Amendment: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion”, and a fourth has been ruled unconstitutional.

So we are at best 4-for-10, with two of the included only out of generosity, and four of the others failing constitutionality (either explicitly, or by plain reading). If we are going to choose a document to trace our laws from, this seems like a bad example.


Our legal systems stem from pre-Christian Rome
----------------------------------------------

The last defense is the idea that our legal tradition somehow stems from the Abrahamic tradition of laws, through a series of Christian nations, and is therefore ultimately a descendant of the Ten Commandments. It is undeniably true that our legal traditions flow from Christian nations. Our government structures were (squinting a bit) inherited from our days of being English colonies, and England is/was a Christian nation. England in turn largely gets its legal tradition from French systems, and France in turn from ancient Rome, which at the end was a mostly Christian nation.

But having come through Christian nations does not make an idea Christian. We get the Arabic numerals though largely those same nations/traditions, and those numerals still originate from the Middle East. And much of our legal structures (juries, written laws, explicitly written charges, judges as separate from the executive branch) did not orriginate in those Christian nations, but already existed in pre-Christian Rome. Rather, Christianity absorbed them as it absorbed pagan Rome (alongside the dates of most modern Christian holidays).

Another approach would be to ask what a Christian/Abrahamic legal system would look like. In the Bible, there are two examples of trials that stand out to me: that of King Solomon and that of Jesus. In the first (remember: Solomon follows Moses), we see the ruler handing down opinions not based on any written law (e.g.: the famous example of ruling to cut a baby in half as a ploy). In Jesus’s court cases from the Bible, three of the six were religious trials for heresy (so totally incompatible with the First Amendment), and the other three were by the Roman Governor and Tribune for incitement to riot, incitement to evade taxes, and calling himself a king.

Importantly, all of these trials (from Solomon and of Jesus) were before executives who had wide latitude to decide the fates of those who came before them. There were certainly some laws/traditions in place (these were civilizations), but it seems that for these powerful men, those were more guidelines than a rule of law. There were no juries, and in the case of Jesus, he should have had legal representation but did not. That does not describe our legal tradition.

So again, our legal traditions don’t seem to be entirely compatible with what can be found in the Bible generally, let alone the Ten Commandments. So our legal system seems to be very different in both source and general theme from any legal system we can see in the Bible.


Summary
----------

To summarize: our laws and legal systems do not flow from the Ten Commandments. The majority of the commandments are not, and have never been, laws in our system. Written law did not start with them, and our legal tradition does not flow from them. Even more, the first three are grossly incompatible with the First Amendment, and a fourth has been found unconstitutional as well.

There is probably a mountain of historical references one can find of people justifying our legal system using examples from the Bible in general, and the Ten Commandments specifically. But none of those actually show any real causality. They are religious people working their religion into government. That is something our founding fathers explicitly sought to avoid (see the First Amendment). Given our national history, it is hard to square those advocating to put religion back into government (like these in Louisiana, or the school superintendent in Oklahoma) as being patriots, or in any way following the wisdom of our founding fathers.
